# Interview Scheduler

An application that allows users to book and cancel interviews.

Development focuses on a single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler, built using React.

Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.

Jest tests are used through the development of the project.
